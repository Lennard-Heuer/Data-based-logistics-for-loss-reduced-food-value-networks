5627;There were weight losses in both varieties (Nerica 1 and  Nerica 2) ranging between 6.19 and 9.35% (Table 4).  The reduction in the weight could also be due to moisture  losses from the grains during storage as well as pest and  insect infestations.;43;Due to moisture
5629;The results of the milling analysis have been presented in  Table 6. The results showed that SB30 had marginally  higher milling yield (67.32%) than SB10 (66%).  However, the differences between the milling yields of  either the SB30 machine and the locally manufactured  milling machine or that of the SB10 machine and the  locally manufactured milling machine were significant.  The locally manufactured milling machine had the lowest  milling yield (63.33%). This implies that the locally  manufactured milling machine was less efficient as it also  resulted in higher percentage (52.7%) of broken grains  (Table 6). This implies that the local machine produced  less white rice per unit weight of paddy. This resulted in  less recoverable rice and therefore less revenue. SB30 is therefore superior to both SB10 and the Local machine in  terms of milling yield. In spite of the higher milling yield of  SB30, it is still lower than the 67.5% (2010 data)  considered to the lowest on record in the USA (Robinson,  2010). According to the author, this could lead to a shift  to selling more broken grains, consequently mean lower  prices. Norman and Otoo (2003) recommended that  improved dehulling and whitening machines should be  developed and tested for use in rice processing;44;The locally  manufactured milling machine was less efficient
5641;The survey finding further showed that most farmers used old technologies for drying cassava chips, including drying on a mat and by the roadside or on wooden platform built over fireplace in the traditional kitchen. Infection by moulds was a major contributor of drying loss. This factor was reported by 68 % of farmers interviewed. The unhygienic conditions created by local drying methods attract pest infestation. The causes of processing loss include cutting deep into the flesh of the tubers during peeling.

5967;Bag Beating/Bambam    The results of the survey showed that harvesting losses  ranged between 3.03 and 12.05% while threshing losses  varied from 0.53 to 4.07% (Table 3). Total losses due to  only harvesting and threshing losses at farmer’s fields  ranged between 5.60 and 16.14%. The differences in  postharvest losses among the farmers were due to  different level of skill of harvesting and threshing as well  as poor weed control. During the study it was observed  that the farmers’ fields were engulfed in a lot of weeds.  Poor weed control is known to interfere with effectiveness  of harvesting (Al-Khatib, 1995).;73;Bag Beating/Bambam

7240;The vast majority of mango farmers interviewed (98%) sold all their produce to  middlemen/brokers at the farm-gate with only 2 percent selling some of the produce to markets  outside Embu district. Usually, no collective bargaining takes place on the price because each  farmer interacts individually with traders (brokers) and as a result, traders take advantage of  farmers by colluding to buy mangoes at prices lower than the prevailing market prices. This  exploitative tendency by buyers who offer very low prices was mentioned by 94 percent of farmers  as the major marketing challenge followed by delayed purchase after harvest (64%). This occurs  when brokers instruct farmers to harvest the mangoes promising to pick them up the next day but   41  then intentionally delay to do so. They then persuade farmers to sell their produce at lower prices  to avoid additional spoilage and loss given that mangoes are highly perishable. On-farm sorting,  grading and bulking of mango fruit is a common practice and is usually done by traders (brokers)  before buying them. They bring their own workers to the farm to harvest the fruit or by giving a  purchasing future date thus advising farmers on when to harvest. In both cases, the buyer meets the  labour costs involved. After sorting, damaged mangoes are rejected by buyers and farmers usually  have to find alternative use or ways to dispose the fruits. Those rejected because of fruit fly  infestation are buried in a deep hole.  The lack of good storage facilities at the farm level was also a major challenge that compelled  54 percent of farmers to sell their mangoes on the day of harvesting. Others (46%) kept them under a  makeshift shed to minimize sunburn, loss of moisture and accumulation of dust for a few days as  they waited to sell. In addition, most access roads to farms are passable only during the dry seasons  of the year but if there are heavy rains during the harvesting period, accessibility is impeded thus  contributing to post-harvest losses and a deterioration of quality leading to low selling prices. When  farmers were asked to rank the attributes that buyers considered as the most important when  selecting mangoes for purchase, 96 percent ranked fruit size first, followed closely by quality (92%),  colour as a maturity indicator (80%) and mango variety (42%). These results reveal the importance  of quality as a key attribute of marketable fruit. It is a compound attribute that refers to the lack of  external or internal damage or injury caused by insect pests, diseases, birds or mechanical damage.;83;No collective bargaining takes place on the price because each  farmer interacts individually with traders (brokers) and as a result, traders take advantage of  farmers by colluding to buy mangoes at prices lower than the prevailing market prices.

The main storage pests  responsible for the losses are larger grain borers (Prostephanus truncatus), grain weevils (Sitophilus  granarius) and, the lesser grain borer (Rhyzopertha dominica). Most of the farmers considered changes in  weather (40%), field damage (33%), and storage pests (16%) as the three most important factors causing  poor crop yields and aggravating food losses. However, survey results suggest that the farmers’ poor  knowledge and skills on post-harvest management are largely responsible for the food losses. 77% of the  surveyed farmers reported inadequate household foods and 41% received food aid during the previous  year. Increasing farmers’ technical know-how on adaptation of the farming systems to climate variability,  and training on post-harvest management could reduce food losses, and improve poverty and household  food security";280;Grain borers (Prostephanus truncatus)

17550;The study revealed that 70% of the surveyed farmers experience  food losses during pre- and post-harvest handling operations,  including during manual processing that cause mechanical  breakage and spillage of the food, and irksomeness to the processor.  Crop losses occur during pre-harvest drying on the field were  caused by wild animals, birds and rodents. In worst cases, up to 32%  of maize-on-cobs could be lost to birds, monkeys, other rodents  before harvest, and through qualitative spoilage by mould and  fungi which could be extensive in wet conditions. Similar qualitative loss through aflatoxin contamination of maize and cassava in  Tanzania and Congo had been reported (Manjula et al., 2009). In  terms of proportion of matured crops, 15% was estimated as preharvest field loss for most grain and legume crops. The farmers  expressed their inability and skills to effectively prevent or control  field losses by pests and rodents. An estimated 1.5% of the maize,  millet, sorghum and groundnut outputs were estimated to be lost  during harvesting. Losses during transportation of the crops by  head-loads, on bicycles and other means were 2.5%. This compares  with 2.25% losses recorded during transportation of rice from the  field to the store and 1% from the store to the market for maize in  Madagascar (Hodges, 2012). An estimated loss of 13.4% for maize  (P ¼ 0.009), 20% for millet and sunflower, 18% for groundnut, 10% for  pigeon pea, 6% for sorghum and 5% for sesame occur when manual  methods of processing were used (Table 4). The losses were in form  of mechanical damage such as breakage, puncture, compression,  rupture, dent bruises, or spillages of the crops.;298;The study revealed that 70% of the surveyed farmers experience  food losses during pre- and post-harvest handling operations,  including during manual processing that cause mechanical  breakage and spillage of the food, and irksomeness to the processor.
